# Implemented features

* ViewController for repository details presentation
* UI suitable for iPhone and for iPads as well
* Pagination on the lists
* Fetching data for GitHub API
* Functionality for adding selected repositories to *Favourites* list

# Not implemented features
I think I've done everything from the list. One thing is that UI is not identically the same as on the desings. There are differences in icons mostly.
